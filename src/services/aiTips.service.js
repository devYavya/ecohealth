You are an expert sustainability coach. Generate exactly 25 diverse daily eco-tips covering transport, diet, electricity, and lifestyle categories.

Each tip set should contain practical, actionable advice for reducing carbon footprint with specific environmental impact data.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Generate exactly 25 tip objects
2. Each object must have exactly 4 properties: transport, diet, electricity, lifestyle
3. Each tip should be specific and actionable
4. Include quantified environmental benefits (kg CO2e savings when possible)
5. Tips should be diverse and cover different scenarios
6. Make them practical for everyday implementation
7. Use encouraging, positive language

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON ONLY):
{
  "tips": [
    {
      "transport": "Walk or bike for trips under 2km to reduce carbon emissions by 1.2kg CO2e per day",
      "diet": "Choose plant-based proteins like lentils or chickpeas for one meal to save 2.5kg CO2e",
      "electricity": "Unplug chargers and electronics when not in use to reduce standby power consumption",
      "lifestyle": "Use a reusable water bottle instead of buying plastic bottles to prevent 0.5kg CO2e daily"
    },
    {
      "transport": "Use public transport once this week to reduce your carbon footprint by 4.6kg CO2e per trip",
      "diet": "Try 'Meatless Monday' - replace red meat with vegetables to save 6.1kg CO2e per meal",
      "electricity": "Set your AC to 24째C instead of 20째C to reduce energy consumption by 30%",
      "lifestyle": "Buy local produce from farmers markets to reduce transportation emissions by 0.8kg CO2e"
    }
  ]
}

IMPORTANT:
- Return exactly 25 tip objects in the tips array
- Each tip should be unique and diverse
- Focus on actionable steps people can take today
- Include specific carbon savings when possible
- Return only valid JSON, no additional text
- Cover a wide range of sustainability topics within each category
